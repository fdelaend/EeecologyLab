#Mission
Welcome to the website of my group at the University of Namur (Belgium). Our main objective is to contribute to a better understanding of how environmental changes affect the composition and structure of communities, and ecosystem functions. Our lab combines mathematical modelling, theory, and experiments.

#Research topics

* Stability:
    + Ever since Robert May's work in the 1970s, we know that community characteristics such as connectance, the number of species, and average interaction strength influence how communities respond to small changes around  equilibrium. However, communities typically face large perturbations while not being at equilibrium. In addition, the same environmental changes that perturb species densities (a lot or a little) may at the same time alter average interaction strengths and thereby the capacity of the community to recover once the perturbation has died out. We need to understand how these various factors change our fundamental understanding of what explains stability.

* Multiple stressors: 
    + Ecosystems are increasingly challenged by multiple drivers of environmental change. Understanding and predicting their combined effects is a pressing scientific and societal need. Substantial effort has been put in unravelling these combined effects at lower levels of biological organisation, e.g. individuals and populations. Yet, it is currently less well understood how these effects scale up to affect the diversity and composition of biological communities and important ecosystem functions they contribute to such as resource use and biomass production. Today, a dominant approach is to test for statistical interactions among environmental change drivers: if the combined effect is weaker/stronger than a predefined expectation (e.g. that effects of the single drivers simply add up), the drivers are classified as interacting antagonistically/synergistically. We propose to complement this approach by the development of mechanistic models and novel experiments. 

* Intraspecific variability: 
    + Intraspecific diversity is increasingly recognised as both an ubiquitous feature of many communities \emph{and} a potential influential factor for coexistence and ecosystem functions. One important aspect is the potential for intraspecific diversity to alter the response of ecosystems to environmental change. This response can be understood in two ways: the resistance against environmental change (the compositional and functional difference between a reference community and a community challenged by some change of an environmental factor), and the speed with which such effects disappear once the environmental factor returns to its reference value. Whether or not intraspecific diversity can buffer or aggravate these responses will depend on the number and identity of included phenotypes, and how these interact with the other community members. We are therefore working on another question that is potentially more important: to what extent is this influence of intraspecific diversity on ecosystem response predictable? 
    
* Coexistence
    + Detailed understanding of environmental change effects on community composition boils down to understanding under which environmental conditions species persist against a backdrop of many other species with which they will interact. To do so we recently engaged in studies on species coexistence. Our initial idea was to examine how environmental stress affected various components of stable coexistence. Then, we realised that these components are not always defined in a consistent way throughout the literature. At present, we are working hard to publish a new take on niche and fitness differences, and inspect how these change with environmental conditions. 
    
* Biodiversity and ecosystem functions
